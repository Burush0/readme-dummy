# readme-dummy
Dummy project to reference how to structure a readme to make a project stand out

### Description
a description section that explains **what** the project is. basically never use the word "just" to not downplay your project. if possible/applicable, include images/gifs to show functionality.

## Why
a section that explains **why** the project exists in the first place. I had problem A and I tried B but it didn't work because C. I built D and now I can do E with ease!

## Quick start
section describing steps to run the project, as short as possible. if prerequisite installations are required, hyperlink their setup pages instead of describing the installation process step-by-step. simpler is better.

## Usage
a more detailed section outlining **how** to use the project. don't go too ham, this is what the `appname --help` would print out if it was a CLI tool.

## Contributing
a section in which you describe how others can help you with the project with their own contributions, outlining the process. E.g. mention that they should fork the repo and once they're done with their bugfix/feature/whatever, they make a pull request to your main branch.
